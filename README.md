# Chemclipse

The Eclipse Chemclipse project offers functionality for data reading and processing in the domain of Cheminformatics and Bioinformatics. Specifically, workflows for chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS), flame-ionization detectors (GC/FID) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) are implemented.

[Chemclipse](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/science.chemclipse) is part of the [Eclipse Science](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/science) working group and is the basis for [OpenChromÂ®](https://github.com/Openchrom/openchrom).
