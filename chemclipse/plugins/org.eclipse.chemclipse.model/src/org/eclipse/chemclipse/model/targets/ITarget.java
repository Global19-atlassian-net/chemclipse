/**
 * A target is used to identify a peak or a chromatogram. This can be done in
 * various ways.<br/>
 * A peak can be identified for example by a mass spectral library search
 * (INCOS, PBM ...) or it could be determined, which origin the mass spectrum
 * has.<br/>
 * And there are still a lot more. The peak identification is implemented as an
 * extension point. So, several different identification methods can be
 * developed if needed.<br/>
 * The chromatogram identification can also be done in several ways.<br/>
 * It can be identified by a summed mass spectrum like in F-Search, or it could
 * be identified by several of its components. Feel free, to implement something
 * :-).
